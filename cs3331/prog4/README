1. How did you make sure htat no students can enter while the landlord is in
the room and checking? Explain your approach in detail.
    - I used a semaphore EnterRoom and ExitRoom and made them wait when the
    landlord entered the room and signal when he left


2. How did you make sure that the landlord will not leave until all students
have left the room? Explain your approach in detail.
    - I wasn't able to figure this out I tried using another semaphore but
    was unsucessfull

3. How did you make sure the message "After checking the room XX times, the
landlord retires and is on vacation!" is the last message printed by your
program?
    - I just made that print out in thread.cpp which caused it to print
    twards the end but nog garuented at the end. I was unable to solve this issue.
