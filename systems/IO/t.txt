trlen(w))): buffer[i] = 0
will set the last character 
of the current buffer to zero. What this 
does is it gets rid of the last \n we read, so we can
print it nicely with puts. 
The bit I suggested in the comments is the use of strncmp. This fu
nction is just like strcmp, but it will only comp
are at most a defined number of bytes. So, with this funct
ion, you can effectively determine if a string starts with the s
ubstring you're looking for. If this strin
g is found, we print the line in which it i
s, print the buffer itself and increment n, 
which is our counter on how many times w was 
found. You should have declared int n = 0; 
in the beginning of the code...
